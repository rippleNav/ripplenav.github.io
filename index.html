      <h2>Module 1</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; training course. This course will teach you how
        to use the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;
        tool to improve your life in many ways.</p>

      <p><b>Before You Begin:</b></p>
      <p>
        The journey described on this site is an advanced one. It presupposes a certain level of personal introspection and a 
        genuine curiosity about the nature of consciousness that goes beyond casual interest.
      </p>
      <p>The best results are achieved by those who can approach the exercises with patience, sincerity, 
        and a mind that is open to possibilities that may challenge conventional beliefs. 
        This exploration is not about debate, but about personal discovery. </p>
      <p>To the casual reader, what we describe here will seem impossible.  
        The bar above is powered by your thoughts. It will move to the right when
        you
        think of something which has some energy attached to it. Its main use is for self-counseling, finding hidden
        things
        in the mind which cause problems for you in your life. Of course, if you do not understand the meaning of the
        motion then it would just seem like nonsense but keep an eye on that bar as you think of various things in your
        life
        and see for your self.</p>

        <p><b>Clarification of the motion:</b></p>
      <p>
      Left motion is usually a 'non confront' of the topic you where thinking of. You did not want deal with what ever it was so it goes left.
      Left motion is "moving away from" right motion is "moving towards" Also, this should be obvious but after a right motion has completed, 
      it would need to return to neutral which requires a left motion. That returning left motion has no 'meaning'.
      </p>

      <p>It's not magic, it uses concepts discovered in quantum physics, but we won't be going into that here at
        all. To learn to use it effectively, you will need to understand how the mind works and how to question
        and search the mind using the above tool which is named &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.
      </p>

      <p>This training course will teach you how to use &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; to find and
        remove hidden blocks in your mind
        which stop you from reaching your full potential in life. It will also teach you how to use RippleNav

      <h2>Identifying Internal Blocks</h2>

      <p>Your goals likely involve improving your career, relationships, or personal growth. Yet, you face Hidden
        Barriers and Inner Blocks. Sometimes, it's Emotional Sabotage - frustration or hesitation holding back
        your progress.
      </p>

      <p>Many people also struggle with Self-Imposed Limits - a fear of using your full potential. This hesitation
        is Mental Interference.</p>

      <p>On a deeper level, Depression and Anxiety can come from Hidden Patterns or Subconscious Programs running
        in the background. These background programs plant Seeds of Doubt, inner voices causing you to give up without
        logical reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depression and anxiety are emotional responses to something in our environment. Sometimes the cause
        seems obvious.
        Worries about job security can cause anxiety. Not reaching goals can make you feel depressed. For some
        people, there's
        no clear cause for their depression or anxiety. It feels like some hidden force is at work.
      </p>

      <p>Past Emotional Wounds (trauma) are dangerous. Things in your safe, present environment can trigger Bad
        Reactions from
        past painful experiences. Your goal is to Remove these bad reactions, leaving only clear, present
        awareness.</p>

      <p>
        PTSD can be devastating for people who have experienced trauma. The problem is that safe situations now
        can trigger
        emotions from unsafe situations in the past. A car backfiring can make someone feel like they're back in
        a gunfight.
        What if those past negative emotions could be cleared away, leaving only calmness instead?
      </p>

      <p>
        To explain what we mean by 'trigger': "Watching sunset waves" could be a trigger if someone you loved
        drowned. "A
        beautiful woman smiling at you" could be a trigger if you once cheated on your wife. We don't know
        everyone's life
        story, so anything could be a trigger. It might seem like a positive situation, but if it causes
        negative emotions for
        that person, we consider it a trigger.

        Before we go to module 2, let me tell you something off topic (slightly). 
        A long time user of this website has written a <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0FBQVQNQK">spy thriller type book</a>a> inspired by the RippleNav.

      <h2>The Mind: Your Personal Information Archive
      </h2>

      <p>As we move to the next step of your training, let's tackle these hidden forces that shape your
        reality.
        To win at life, we need to understand a simple but important idea about how your mind works.</p>
      <p>Nobody fully understands the mind, not even our top experts. Different specialists have their own ideas
        about it.
        Western doctors often say the mind is in the physical brain, while spiritual experts see it as energy or
        consciousness
        that goes beyond your body.</p>
      <p>For our purposes, you don't need to pick one theory about where the mind lives. Instead, we'll use a
        simple
        model that
        helps us create powerful tools. These tools will help fight anxiety, depression, negativity, and
        other problems
        that stop you from reaching your full potential and creating your best life.</p>
      <p>In our model, the mind works like your personal information files, storing memories and experiences. Knowledge
        is
        key for
        navigating your life in this world. The fact that you can understand these words is because you can
        access
        memories of
        how you learned to read and understand language.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Tab3" class="tabcontent">
      <h2>Module 3</h2>
      <h2>
        The Flow of Conscious and Unconscious
      </h2>

      <p>
        The library of your mind can be understood as having two distinct wings or chambers, the conscious and
        the
        unconscious. Let's explore what these terms actually mean for your inner landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your conscious thoughts are those you're fully aware of and can intentionally direct. When you feel
        hunger arising in
        your body and decide to drive to a restaurant for nourishment, you're making a conscious choice. If
        someone were to ask
        what you're doing, you could easily explain your actions and the reasoning behind them. You're fully
        present with these
        thoughts and decisions, they exist within your awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unconscious thoughts, however, exist beneath the surface of your awareness, like the deeper currents
        beneath the ocean
        waves. Imagine suddenly feeling a wave of anger when you see something as simple and innocent as a
        tomato. This reaction
        makes no logical sense to your conscious mind. You aren't aware of any rational reason for this
        emotional response, it
        simply emerges from somewhere deeper within you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "unconscious thoughts" isn't entirely accurate, because by definition, a thought is something
        we're aware
        of, and we aren't directly aware of what happens below our level of consciousness. This hidden realm is
        also sometimes
        called the subconscious mind, where "sub" beautifully indicates that these processes occur beneath our
        conscious
        awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we can see that there are two primary forces guiding your actions and responses in any given moment:
        <br>
        (1) First, your conscious thoughts, which are decisions you make based on information you're aware of
        and can evaluate.
        <br>
        (2) Second, your unconscious influences, which manifest as reactions, inexplicable urges, seemingly
        irrational emotional
        responses, or decisions that later leave you wondering why you made them.

      </p>
      <p>Your conscious thoughts are mindfully chosen based on what your awareness recognizes as helpful or
        appropriate
        information.
      </p>

      <P>Your unconscious influences, however, emerge as reactions, unexplained impulses to act in ways that might
        not make
        logical sense, decisions that confuse you when you reflect on them later, or emotions that seem to arise
        from nowhere
        and feel beyond your control.</P>

      <p>
        Understanding this flow between the conscious and unconscious realms is our first step toward better
        understanding. In
        our next module, we'll begin exploring how these two aspects of your mind interact and how you can bring
        greater harmony
        to their relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a moment to reflect on a recent emotional reaction that surprised you. Can you identify whether it came
        from
        conscious reasoning or unconscious influences? This awareness is already the beginning of your transformation.

      <h2>Module 4</h2>

      <h2>
        The Network of Shared Information
      </h2>

      <p>We're about to explore something fascinating: where the mind stores its valuable information. This is an
        area
        where
        many theories exist, and people might have strong opinions about it. That's normal - our
        understanding
        of the mind is still developing.
      </p>
      <p>We could dive into complex areas like neural networks, brain chemistry, or even quantum physics, but that
        would take
        us beyond our current education goals.
      </p>

      <p>Our field research has revealed something important: what we call "subconscious information" may not be stored
        only in our
        individual brain systems, but in a shared network, a collective field that connects all people.
      </p>
      <p>This doesn't mean individual brain-based memories don't exist - they do. If you have a medical condition
        affecting
        memory, that likely needs traditional medical support. The challenges we're addressing seem to come from
        this deeper
        shared network that influences your subconscious operations.
      </p>
      <p>We share this insight because our enhancement program, which has helped thousands of people transform
        their
        lives, can't be fully explained through standard models of individual memory storage. We'll continue
        using this shared
        network model because it explains the challenges we discussed earlier and gives us practical ways to
        overcome them.
      </p>
      <p>You might find this concept unusual at first, but remember, we're working with a model designed to solve
        real
        problems many people face daily.
      </p>
      <p>In our model, memories exist in a collective field, which means they're all held in the same space. Let
        me offer a
        field analogy to help visualize this.
      </p>

      <p>Imagine a vast central information system, a universal network, where instead of storing all information
        in our individual
        minds, everything is recorded in this infinite field. We access these files through time and location
        coordinates.
        When you know where you were at a specific moment, you can reconnect with what happened through this
        collective
        system.
      </p>

      <p>I know the idea of shared intelligence might seem strange. But think of it as a useful model for a deeper
        truth:
        memory isn't just personal property, it's a collective map created from our shared human experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I try to explain higher dimensions to people, I find it helpful to start by taking a step back, or
        rather,
        a step
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a sheet of paper with absolutely no thickness. Only width and length exist in this world. Let's
        call
        it
        Flatland, home to beings who only experience two dimensions. These flat beings live their entire lives
        unaware
        that they
        exist on a piece of paper in our three-dimensional reality. The concept of "height" is as foreign to
        them
        as... well, as
        a fourth dimension might be to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now picture what happens when a ping pong ball from our world gently rolls onto this paper. The
        Flatlanders
        wouldn't see
        a ball, they'd only perceive the tiny point where the sphere touches their plane. Perhaps they'd also
        notice a
        shadow, a
        darkening of their world where the ball blocks light from above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you imagine the confusion? Their newspapers might report on a mysterious dot that appeared without
        explanation, and
        how darkness fell upon part of their world while the rest remained in light. Their leaders would have no
        answers. In
        this vacuum of understanding, people would create their own explanations, often turning to religious
        interpretations,
        suggesting it must be divine intervention requiring offerings, pilgrimages, and donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a scientist in Flatland proposed the existence of a third dimension called "height," how would she
        explain
        it? She
        might use mathematics to prove it should exist everywhere, not just where the strange phenomena
        occurred. But
        drawing or
        visualizing this dimension would be nearly impossible within their two-dimensional framework. The
        establishment might
        feel threatened by such radical ideas, leading to conflict, suppression, and possibly even imprisonment
        for
        the
        scientist suggesting such "heretical" concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This story might seem amusing to us three-dimensional beings. We understand height intuitively, it's
        part of
        our daily
        experience. But are we perhaps making the same mistake as the Flatlanders when we dismiss the
        possibility of
        higher
        dimensions?
      </p>
      <p>
        A fourth dimension would follow the same principle: it would completely envelope our three-dimensional
        reality
        while
        remaining largely invisible to us. Objects from a fourth dimension might seem to magically appear and
        disappear as they
        intersect with our world, just as the ping pong ball's touch point appeared as a dot to the Flatlanders.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what about fifth, sixth, or even higher dimensions? Mathematically, they should exist, though
        they're
        increasingly
        difficult for our three-dimensional minds to conceptualize. Throughout history, those who have explored
        such
        concepts
        have often faced resistance, accused of witchcraft, heresy, or simply dismissed as delusional.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have found that the mind itself exists in a higher dimension, a shared space that transcends our
        physical
        reality.
        This
        might sound far-fetched until you consider technologies like the RippleNav, which responds to thoughts
        without
        physical
        contact, unaffected by distance or conventional limitations of space and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In experiments conducted between continents, with an electronic circuit sensitive to thought, thought
        responses
        arrived instantaneously, despite network delays
        that should have created noticeable lag. This suggests the response was generated before the thought was
        even
        fully
        formed, something that seems impossible in our linear, three-dimensional understanding of time. But if
        thoughts
        exist in a higher dimension outside of time as we know it, such phenomena become possible. From this
        perspective,
        time
        itself may be merely a three-dimensional illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The closest scientific framework we have to explain these phenomena might be quantum mechanics, where
        the
        observer
        effect demonstrates that simply watching an experiment can influence its outcome, something physicists
        have
        been
        puzzling over since the early 1900s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many experts insist all thinking happens within the brain, but perhaps the brain is simply an interface.
        a
        three-dimensional connection point to our higher-dimensional selves. This perspective opens new
        possibilities
        for
        understanding and addressing what we call "mental illness" in our three-dimensional framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        I invite you to explore these concepts with an open mind and heart. The universe is far more mysterious
        and
        interconnected than we've been taught to believe.

      </p>

      <p>Let me share a more poetic way to envision this concept.

      </p>

      <p>Imagine that beneath all of us lies a vast lake, its surface as smooth and reflective as the clearest
        mirror.
        And we, as
        conscious beings, possess the miraculous ability to walk upon these waters. Though this might seem
        impossible to
        our logical minds, let's embrace this vision and explore what it reveals.
      </p>
      <p>As we move across this mystical lake, each of our footsteps creates ripples that expand outward from the
        exact
        point
        where our foot touches the water. Notice that these ripples begin at the precise moment of contact,
        neither
        before nor
        after, marking each moment perfectly in time.
      </p>
      <p>We're not alone in this extraordinary experience. Countless others also journey across these waters,
        their
        steps also
        creating ripples that spread outward until they gradually fade away. Where these countless ripples meet
        and
        cross, they
        create intricate patterns of interference that dance across the lake's reflective surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we were to capture images of this lake at regular intervals, we would document its endless
        transformations.
        To reveal
        what happened at any particular moment and location, we would simply need to look at the photograph from
        that
        moment and
        observe the unique pattern of ripples present there.
      </p>
      <p>So you see, location and time become the keys that unlock our access to memory. Like ripples on a cosmic
        lake,
        each
        event sends waves through the universe, forever altering its delicate surface in ways that can later be
        recognized and
        understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was this beautiful analogy that inspired us to name our healing tool
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, because it helps us navigate through
        the ripples on the lake of consciousness, allowing us to find and remove the patterns that no longer
        serve
        our
        highest good.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our next module, we'll begin exploring how these ripples of memory influence our present experience,
        and how
        we can
        work with them to create positive transformation in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a moment to sit with this image of the lake of consciousness. Can you feel how we're all connected
        through
        these
        waters? How your ripples might touch others in ways you never imagined?

        <h2>
          The Hidden Importance of Time and Location
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following may seem obvious but it is very important, how time and location affect your
          consciousness and create the hidden patterns that misdirect your actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the perspective of the mind, we experience full consciousness when we have complete awareness of
          our exact time and
          location. Think about how grounded you feel when you're fully present, aware of exactly where you are
          and when it is.
          But as we begin to lose track of these coordinates, perhaps when we're falling asleep, daydreaming, or
          experiencing
          shock, we drift toward unconsciousness. Complete unconsciousness occurs when we have absolutely no
          awareness of time or
          place.
        </p>

        <p>
          How might this create challenges in your life? Let me share an illuminating example. </p>
        <p>
          Imagine that you and another person experience an accident together, perhaps a minor car accident. In
          that
          moment of shock and fear, both of you are knocked into a state of partial unconsciousness. Even in this
          altered state,
          your minds continue recording everything, the sounds, sensations, emotions, but the clarity around time
          and location
          becomes blurred or entirely missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the complex emotions, the fear, pain, shock, and confusion, are recorded with perfect accuracy, but
          there's no clear
          separation between your experience and your friend's experience. Your minds perceive as if you were
          occupying the exact
          same time and space, even though physically you were standing a few feet apart. The distinction between
          which memories
          belong to whom becomes blended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we are referring to subconscious memories, not conscious memories. You won't suddenly believe
          you are your friend,
          but you might display behaviors, reactions, or emotional responses that actually originated with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          This creates a profound ripple effect because our subconscious mind contains a survival mechanism
          that warns us of potential danger based on our past experiences. When we encounter a dangerous situation
          in the present,
          it triggers subconscious memories of similar past experiences, EVEN THOSE OBTAINED WAY DOWN YOUR GENETIC
          LINE. When you suddenly see a snake on a hiking path or
          encounter a bear in the woods, your body instantly responds, muscles tense, adrenaline flows, fear rises
          within you, and
          you're prepared to respond for your safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          These aren't thoughtful decisions, they're instantaneous reactions. While your conscious mind engages in
          thoughtful
          contemplation, your subconscious mind simply releases stored emotional patterns from the past without
          evaluating whether
          those emotions are truly relevant to your current circumstance.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p>
          Returning to our example with the car accident, years later, you might find yourself walking down a
          street when a
          car backfires loudly nearby. That sudden sound triggers your mind to access both your unconscious
          memories and your
          friend's unconscious memories from that earlier traumatic event, preparing you to respond as if you're
          in danger again.
          It's important to understand that only the unconscious memories become intermingled this way, not your
          conscious
          recollections. You won't suddenly believe you are your friend, but you might display behaviors,
          reactions, or emotional
          responses that actually originated with them.

        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look more closely at why this happens. During the traumatic event, your time and location
          awareness became foggy
          or disappeared completely, but you retained a general pre-unconsciousness sense of where you were. When
          something in the
          present triggers a recall of that event, your mind automatically searches for memories from that vague
          location and
          timeframe.

        <p>
          Because your friend was nearby during the original incident, their unconscious emotional patterns also
          get gathered and
          presented to you as if they were your own. This is how you can find yourself experiencing emotional
          responses that don't
          actually originate from your own life history. The collective consciousness simply provides all the
          <b>nearby</b> data without
          distinguishing between sources. The fogginess of the location prevents the collective consciousness from
          obtaining the
          precise memory location of where you were at the time.

        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          The haziness of time and location during moments of trauma acts as a "memory merger" for the unconscious
          minds involved
          in the incident. It's important to note that not every experience creates this phenomenon, it
          specifically occurs during
          what we call a Unifying Traumatic Experience, or UTE.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traumatic experiences evoke complex, intense emotions, fear, anger, panic, confusion. When you're
          in survival mode,
          experiencing intense pain or feeling near death, you're unlikely to maintain calm awareness. All those
          powerful emotions
          get recorded in the collective consciousness, waiting to resurface when your subconscious attention
          returns to that
          merged experience.
        </p>
        <p>You might imagine a "memory merger" as a foggy cloud connecting you and the other person in the car
          accident, subconsciously linking you together.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>
          These "memory mergers," of which we each have many, connect us energetically to countless other people
          who each carry their
          own constellation of emotional patterns, and they become the hidden influences behind many of our
          challenges. Your
          unexplained anger, seemingly irrational fears, or recurring patterns of behavior may originate from
          these merged
          sources. These individuals aren't consciously aware of this energetic connection. They don't
          intentionally share their
          emotional patterns with you, nor do they realize that you might be a source of influence in their lives
          as well.

        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>You might be thinking skeptically about this concept right now, wondering if it could possibly be true.
          Or perhaps you believe it doesn't apply to you because you haven't experienced any significant trauma
          that you can recall. But remember what we learned in Module 4 about our collective consciousness model,
          this field is timeless, existing since the very beginning, accumulating the ripples of your actions
          since your very first experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're not suggesting any particular religious perspective here. Whatever your spiritual beliefs might
          be, when you begin
          looking for these Unifying Traumatic Experiences in your own life, you'll discover that you already
          carry many of them.
          The collective mind operates independently of your opinions or belief systems. Our purpose is simply to
          help you
          understand what these experiences are, how they affect your daily life, and most importantly, how to
          permanently remove their influence.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          In the modules ahead, we'll often refer to the "merge" and the "source" as simple ways to encapsulate
          these concepts. The merge incident connects you to a source of influence. To release yourself from the
          effects of these sources, we need to locate and heal these merge incidents.
        </p>

        <p><span class="amberBack">
            To summarize what we've explored today: a Unifying Traumatic Experience causes the time and location
            information
            surrounding that incident to become confused, creating a 'merge' that connects you energetically to
            many 'sources' of
            psychological patterns that may not originate with you.</span></p>
        <p>
          In our next module, we'll begin learning practical techniques to identify these merges and remove their
          influence in
          your life. The awareness you're gaining right now is already the beginning of your transformation.

        </p>
        <p>
          Take a moment to reflect on this information with an open heart. Notice if any experiences in your own
          life might
          connect to what we've discussed today. Remember, awareness is the first step toward change.

      <h2>Module 6</h2>
      <h2>
        Finding Your Personal Unlock Code or 'magic number'
      </h2>



      <p>In our previous briefing, we explored "The Time and Location Problem", how during moments of
        stress or
        intense emotion, your neural system can mix your memories with others who shared that space with you.
        These
        mixed signals continue to affect your emotional responses, behaviors, and even your identity.</p>
      <p>I'm pleased to report that there is a simple way to untangle these mixed signals and restore your true
        emotional state. The process has two key steps: finding the specific event that created the mix, and
        discovering exactly
        how many people were involved in that shared experience.</p>
      <p>When you find the exact number of people who were present during that event, something powerful
        happens.
        Your mind recognizes this number as the truth and a key that unlocks the mixed memories, allowing them
        to separate and return
        to their proper owners. The relief from this simple discovery can feel almost immediate, which is why we
        call this
        the "magic number."</p>

      <p>Think of it as a code that, when entered, allows your subconscious to reorganize its understanding of
        past experiences,
        freeing you from carrying emotional patterns that don't authentically belong to you. This is a crucial
        step in your
        journey toward reclaiming your true self.</p>

      <p>To be clear, there's nothing high-tech or supernatural happening here, even though the results might seem
        remarkable. The term "magic number" simply means the exact count of people whose subconscious data got
        mixed with yours during a
        Unifying Traumatic Experience.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>To help you navigate this field operation of self-discovery, we've developed a specialized tool called
        the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.
        This tool is designed to interact with the collective intelligence network and help you navigate through
        the complex
        signal patterns we discussed in earlier modules.</p>
      <p>In upcoming briefings, we'll frequently refer to these "magic numbers" as a direct way to express
        this powerful concept of numerical intel that separates mixed experiences.</p>
      <p>However, I need to inform you that you will need to engage in work during this recovery process.</p>
      <p>First, pinpointing the specific Unifying Traumatic Experience where the mixing occurred can be
        challenging if you are
        not well trained in using the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text> tool.</p>
      <p>Second, accessing subconscious memories that have been stored deep within your mind will require special
        assistance
        through the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>. It is an essential field device that you must
        become proficient with.</p>




      <hr>
      <p>
        From a more spiritual viewpoint, we can understand these merges as energetic entanglements between
        people who
        have shared profound experiences. Just as quantum particles can become entangled across vast distances,
        human consciousness
        can form connections that transcend our ordinary understanding of separation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding your magic number is essentially a process of quantum disentanglement, allowing each person's
        experience
        to return to its rightful owner, freeing everyone involved from carrying emotional patterns that don't
        authentically
        belong to them.
      </p>

      <hr>
      <p>
        You might be wondering how this process will feel when you experience it. Many people describe a sense
        of
        lightness, as if a weight they didn't even know they were carrying has been lifted. Others report sudden
        clarity about
        patterns in their lives that previously seemed inexplicable. Some experience immediate relief from
        emotional or even
        physical symptoms that had persisted for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty of this process lies in its simplicity. Once the magic number is recognized, the mind
        naturally
        reorganizes its understanding of past experiences without requiring lengthy analysis or processing. It's
        as if all it needed
        was this one piece of information to complete a healing process it always knew how to perform.
      </p>


      <hr>
      <p>
        In our next module, we'll explore the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; tool in greater
        detail,
        learning how to use it effectively to discover your magic numbers and begin releasing these merged
        experiences from your energy field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that this journey is uniquely yours. While I'm here to guide you through the process, the
        discoveries
        you make will be deeply personal and profoundly transformative. Each magic number you uncover is another
        step toward
        reclaiming your authentic truth and liberating yourself from influences that never truly belonged to
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a moment now to sit with the concept we've explored today. Perhaps you can bring to mind a
        situation where
        you experienced an emotional reaction that felt disproportionate or somehow not quite your own. This
        awareness is
        already preparing you for the healing work to come.
      </p>



      <hr>








      <p>
        In upcoming modules, we often refer to "magic numbers" as a simple way to encapsulate this concept.

      </p>





      <p>
        There are two difficulties regarding locating magic numbers: <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Locating the specific incident where the merging occurred.</li>
        <li>Accessing subconscious memories that are buried deep within.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <p>
        You will need help in the form of a special tool that can interact with the collective subconscious and
        navigate
        around all those ripples. We will
        discuss this tool in the next section.

      <h2>Module 7</h2>


      <h2>The Art of Finding Your Truth</h2><br><br>


      <p>
        I'm excited to share this process with you because it's both profoundly simple and incredibly powerful. While
        the concept might seem complex at first, I promise that once you grasp it, you'll be amazed at how intuitive it
        becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's begin with a familiar example that will help us understand the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you're playing a simple guessing game with another person. They've chosen a secret number between 1 and
        100,
        and you want to find it as quickly as possible. Now, you could start guessing random numbers, 17, 42, 83, but
        that might
        take a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, there's a much more elegant approach. Let me show you how it works:
      </p>

      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>You start by asking, "Is your number greater than 50?"</li>
        <li>If they say "Yes," you immediately know the number is somewhere between 51 and 100, and you've eliminated
          half of all possibilities with just one question.
        </li>
        <li>Next, you ask, "Is your number greater than 75?"
        </li>
        <li>If they say "Yes," you now know the number is between 76 and 100, and you've narrowed it down even
          further.
        </li>
        <li>You continue this dance of questions, "Is it greater than 87?", each time dividing the remaining range in
          half until you
          zero in on the exact number.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's connect this to your goal of awesome person. The magic numbers we discussed in our previous module,
        those
        precise counts of people involved in Unifying Traumatic Experiences, can be discovered using this same approach
        through
        our specialized tool called the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.


      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; as a compass for navigating the vast ocean of
        collective consciousness. Just as a compass responds to the Earth's magnetic field with gentle movements, the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; responds to the quantum field of
        consciousness with subtle motions that guide us toward our magic numbers.


      </p>

      <h>
        <p>
          When using the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, you'll be looking for a brief, subtle motion to
          the right, a gentle movement that confirms
          you're on the right path. This motion might be very slight or more pronounced, but with practice, you'll
          become attuned
          to recognizing it.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          Let me walk you through how this works in practical terms:
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine we're searching for a magic number that could be anywhere between 1 and 100. We begin by asking (in
          thought), "Is
          the magic number greater than 50?" and observe the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we see that gentle motion to the right, we know our number is in the upper half, between 51 and 100.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then divide that range in half and ask, "Is the magic number greater than 75?"
        </p>
        <p>
          If there's no motion this time, we know our number is between 51 and 75.
        </p>
        <p>
          We continue this dance, asking questions and observing the responses, each time narrowing down the
          field until we arrive at the precise number that represents our truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow me to caution you. We are only interested in brief right-motions <span
            style="color:rgb(241, 185, 29);background-color: #464646;">in response to a question we proposed in
            thought</span>. Motions which occurs two seconds after you pose the question are not relevant and should be
          ignored.
        </p>


        <hr>

        <p>
          Let me offer one more way to understand this process. Imagine you're standing in a vast, dark room, holding a
          special
          light that illuminates only half the room at a time. You're searching for a small, precious gem.
        </p>
        <p>
          You shine your light on the right half of the room and ask, "Is my gem in this light?" The
          &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; gives you a
          gentle
          signal that yes, it is. Now you know you can focus entirely on that half of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          You divide that illuminated section in half again and shine your light on the far corner. Again, you ask and
          receive
          confirmation. With each question, your search area becomes smaller, and you get closer to finding your gem,
          your magic
          number.
        </p>


        <hr>


        <p>
          The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; operates through quantum mechanical principles, the same
          fascinating field of physics that reveals how
          particles can be interconnected across vast distances. The deeper mechanics of how it works are beyond what we
          need to
          understand to use it effectively, just as you don't need to understand how a smartphone processes information
          to make
          a
          call.
        </p>
        <p>
          With practice, this process becomes second nature. Most people can locate a magic number in under 30 seconds
          once
          they've developed a feel for the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;. It's like learning to ride a
          bicycle, it might seem challenging at first,
          but
          once you get it, it becomes effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that when you're working with the actual &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, you'll need
          to maintain a clear, focused state of mind.
          Your physical well-being plays an important role too, proper nutrition, particularly adequate levels of
          vitamin B,
          helps
          maintain the neural connections that allow you to perceive the subtle responses of the
          &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.
        </p>












        <br><br>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          I encourage you to practice finding some numbers such as how many leaves are on a nearby tree. We wont
          actually go and count them. The idea is just to practice your RippleNav skills on something meaningless until
          you feel comfortable with it. . This
          practice is invaluable because finding your magic numbers is at the heart of this entire healing journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; is like any tool, it requires practice, patience, and
          presence to use effectively. But I promise you
          that the rewards of mastering it are profound. Each magic number you discover is a key that unlocks a piece of
          your
          authentic self, freeing you from merged patterns that have influenced your life in ways you may never have
          realized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take some time now to practice as much as you can. And know that each
          practice session is preparing you for the real healing work to come.

      <p>
        In this lesson, we're expanding our awareness to embrace something truly magnificent, the vastness of the magic
        numbers we may
        encounter on our healing journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we've been exploring how to use the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; to uncover the magic
        numbers
        in our collective consciousness, we've
        primarily focused on smaller numbers. But I want to prepare you for the full spectrum of what you might
        discover.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; to reveal numbers in the unconscious mind, you'll
        find
        that they span an incredible range.
        About 70% of the magic numbers you'll encounter will fall somewhere between 1,000 and 30,000, numbers we can
        easily
        comprehend.
      </p>


      <p>
        But the remaining 30% might take us into realms of magnitude that stretch our imagination. And this is where our
        journey
        becomes even more fascinating.

        <li>Hundred</li>
        <li>Thousand</li>
        <li>Million</li>
        <li>Billion</li>
        <li>Trillion</li>
        <li>Quadrillion</li>
        <li>Quintillion</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To navigate these vast numerical landscapes, it helps to understand how we name different scales of numbers.
        You
        may
        remember some of these from your school days, but let's refresh our understanding together:
      </p>

      <p>We begin with numbers without a specific scale name, the ones, tens, and so on. Then we have hundreds. Next
        come
        thousands. Beyond that are millions. Then billions. Followed by trillions. Then quadrillions. And quintillions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these scales represents a vastness ten times greater than the one before it. It's like looking at the
        night
        sky
        and seeing not just the stars visible to our naked eye, but then using a telescope to reveal thousands more, and
        then
        learning about the billions of galaxies beyond what even our strongest telescopes can see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, don't worry, you won't need to perform complex calculations or mathematical operations. You simply need to
        be
        able
        to count and understand which numbers are larger and which are smaller on this cosmic scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that big numbers can feel overwhelming. If I asked you whether 5,678,996,433,243 is larger than
        5,778,986,433,243, you might feel your mind swimming with all those digits. But if I asked whether 5.6 trillion
        is
        larger than 5.7 trillion, you could answer immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the beauty of grouping numbers into these more manageable scales, it allows us to compare values more
        intuitively. Understanding these naming scales helps you recognize that trillions are larger than billions,
        billions
        are
        larger than millions, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might seem obvious, but it's crucial for finding the <image-text>correct</image-text> magic number.
        Remember,
        we won't release anything in
        the mind unless we discover the authentic magic number. With practice and patience, you'll become more
        comfortable
        working with and comparing these larger values.
      </p>


      <hr>





      <h2>But what about truly immense numbers?</h2>

      <p>Those that extend beyond even quadrillions or quintillions? When numbers reach this magnitude, we use another
        approach
        that's beautifully simple: we count the digits rather than trying to identify the full number.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the number "one million" has seven digits: 1,000,000. That's seven places from the first 1 to the
        last
        0.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>Some of the largest magic numbers we've encountered in our work contain around 800 billion digits. Try to
        imagine
        that
        for a moment, not a number that's 800 billion, but a number that has 800 billion digits. It's a vastness that
        transcends
        our typical understanding.</p>

      <p>In those cases, approximating the number of digits was sufficient to release the mind's merged unconscious
        memories. The
        conscious recognition of this immensity was enough to allow the truth to emerge.
      </p>

      <p>This brings us to an important insight: you don't always need to identify the exact number down to the very
        last
        digit.
        Getting close to 23,000 might work just as effectively as pinpointing the full 23,451. This understanding can
        greatly
        accelerate your healing process.
      </p>

      <hr>


      <p>
        Remember, the purpose of finding a magic number is for the mind to recognize its truth. Sometimes you'll need
        the
        exact
        value, while other times an approximation will suffice to uncover the authentic pattern. Trust your intuition
        and
        the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; to guide you to what works in each unique situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally important is approaching these numbers without judgment. Don't dismiss a number because 800 billion
        digits
        seems
        implausible or because it doesn't align with what you think "should" be true. The mind operates according to its
        own
        innate wisdom, not according to our expectations or preconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it this way: if you were to count every grain of sand on all the beaches of Earth, you'd reach an
        unimaginably
        huge number. If you tried to count every star in our galaxy, you'd reach another vast sum. The mind's capacity
        for
        complexity rivals these cosmic scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we work with very large numbers, we're acknowledging that the patterns in our consciousness can be as
        intricate
        and
        vast as the universe itself. Just as astronomers use different tools to measure cosmic distances, sometimes in
        light-years, sometimes in parsecs, we adapt our approach based on the scale we're working with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me share another perspective that might help. Think of your consciousness as a vast, ancient tree with roots
        that
        extend deep into the earth and branches that reach toward the sky. Some merged memories might be like leaves on
        the
        nearest branches, easily identified and released with specific, smaller numbers. Others might be like patterns
        within
        the
        deepest roots, requiring us to acknowledge their vastness rather than trying to count every root fiber.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you continue your practice with the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, approach these larger
        numbers
        with the same patient curiosity you
        would bring to exploring a new landscape. Don't let their magnitude intimidate you. Instead, recognize that your
        consciousness has been collecting experiences across a vast spectrum, and the healing we're doing honors that
        full
        range.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that this journey is not about perfection but about uncovering your authentic truth. Trust the process,
        trust
        the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, and most importantly, trust your own inner wisdom as you
        navigate these numerical landscapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our next module, we'll begin applying these understandings to identify and release specific memory merges,
        using
        all the tools we've explored so far.

      <h2>Module 9</h2>
      <h2>Preparing Body, Mind, and Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        This is essential knowledge for your success in life, how to create the optimal conditions for
        working with the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; and connecting with the deeper layers of
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as a gardener prepares the soil before planting seeds, we need to prepare ourselves to engage with this
        work. The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; is a sensitive instrument that responds to your energy
        and clarity of intention. Let's explore
        how to create the perfect environment for this process.
      </p>
      <h2>The Wisdom of Physical Wellbeing</h2>


      <p>The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; will
        not respond effectively if you're unwell,
        exhausted, or under the influence of heavy medication or substances. This is actually a natural
        safeguard, because working with the subconscious mind can sometimes be intense and requires you to be fully
        present and centered.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; isn't responding as it should, take a moment to
        check in with your physical wellbeing.
        Are you fighting off an illness? Did you get enough rest last night? Have you taken any medications that might
        be
        affecting your clarity?
      </p>
      <p>
        Another great way to prepare your body is to get your blood flowing. Movement creates energy, and energy
        creates connection. Take a gentle walk in nature, do some stretching, or practice a few yoga poses, whatever
        feels right
        for your body. For our elders on this journey, even gentle movements while seated can help awaken the
        body's natural
        flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, despite our best preparations, we might simply be having an off day. The cosmic energies might not be
        aligned, or perhaps your body is processing something on a deep level. In these moments, practice patience and
        self-compassion. There's wisdom in waiting for a better time, perhaps later in the day or even the following
        morning.
      </p>

      <h2>Nourishing Mental Clarity
      </h2>



      <p>
        Mental clarity is like a window through which we perceive our inner landscape. When the window is clean and
        clear, we can see with precision and detail. When it's clouded or foggy, our perception becomes limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our experience, taking a vitamin B complex in the morning can support mental alertness. These
        vitamins nourish your nervous system and help maintain the energetic pathways in your brain. However, I
        recommend
        avoiding vitamin B after 2:00 in the afternoon, as it might interfere with your natural sleep rhythms. If you
        need to
        stay awake during the evening hours, though, vitamin B1 in 250mg tablets can be particularly supportive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another wonderful ally for mental clarity is Omega-3, which you can find in fish oil or, for my plant-based
        friends, in flaxseed oil. A deficiency in these essential fatty acids can create what many describe as "brain
        fog", a state
        where thinking feels clouded and sluggish.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high-quality multivitamin can also provide sufficient B vitamins to support your work with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;. And
        while we're discussing supplements, it's worth mentioning that certain medications, particularly those for
        headaches or
        pain, can induce drowsiness or create a disconnected feeling that might interfere with your ability to connect
        clearly with the collective consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I always recommend consulting with your healthcare provider before beginning any new supplement
        regimen. Our bodies are unique, and what works beautifully for one person might not be right for another.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <h2>Creating Quiet Space</h2>



      <p>
        Beyond physical and mental preparation, it's important to create an environment free from distractions. Just as
        you would prepare a quiet space for meditation or yoga, create a special place for your work with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you're well-nourished before beginning, working with an empty stomach can pull your attention away
        from
        the subtle responses of the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;. Also consider what might distract
        you during your session. Is your neighbor
        having a gathering with loud music? Is your car parked in a time-limited space where you might receive a ticket?
        Are you
        expecting an important call?
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a few moments to address these potential distractions before you begin. Perhaps silence your phone or turn
        it off completely if possible. Close the windows if outside noise is disruptive. Create a container of time and
        space
        where you can be fully present with this healing work.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <h2>The Journey Into Deeper Consciousness</h2>




      <p>
        Something interesting you might notice when working with the unconscious mind, you may suddenly find yourself
        feeling incredibly drowsy or yawning repeatedly. This is actually quite natural, as you're engaging with aspects
        of
        consciousness associated with times when you were partially or fully unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might even feel yourself drifting toward sleep while searching for magic numbers. When this happens, gently
        bring yourself back to alertness. Stand up for a moment, move your body, perhaps splash some cool water on your
        face,
        and then continue. This drowsiness will resolve itself as you progress in your practice.
      </p>


      <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

      <br><br>

      <h2>The Path of Sequences
      </h2>




      <p>
        As you begin working with the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, you'll discover that magic numbers
        often appear in sequences of related
        incidents. While you'll experience healing shifts along the entire journey, the most profound transformation
        typically occurs when you reach the first or earliest magic number in a sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general approach is to continue finding and releasing magic numbers, moving backward through time along the
        sequence until you reach that initiating event, the first magic number on that particular thread of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to pause your work before reaching that first magic number, please know that's completely fine.
        Nothing negative will happen. You can simply continue with that sequence during your next session with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.
        The healing work you've already completed remains intact.
      </p>



      <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <br><br>
      <hr>
      <br><br>

      <h2>The Healing Release
      </h2>




      <p>
        In later modules, I'll guide you through specific, step-by-step methods for releasing the negative
        effects of these memory merges. But the essential process involves finding a sequence of incidents connected to
        the
        challenge you wish to overcome, then working backward through that sequence (from latest to earliest),
        discovering the magic number for each incident, which releases the trapped energy and emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of this work is typically a profound sense of relief and completeness. The issue that was
        troubling you may feel completely resolved or significantly diminished. To fully release a complex pattern,
        you'll usually
        need to work with all the sequences related to that specific challenge. These are powerful processes that bring
        remarkable results.
      </p>

      <h2>Expanding Your Consciousness</h2>


      <p>
        Before we conclude today's exploration, I'd like to share a special practice that can help new people who
        haven't yet developed the level of self-awareness needed to fully engage with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;. If you find yourself "stuck in
        your head" and unable to receive clear responses, this consciousness expansion exercise can help you extend your
        awareness beyond your usual boundaries.
      </p>



      <p>
        Take a moment now to close your eyes and imagine yourself growing larger and larger. Feel yourself expanding
        until your feet are touching the Earth and the top of your head reaches all the way to the moon. In your mind's
        eye, look
        down and see your feet firmly planted on our beautiful planet. Look up and feel the moon gently brushing against
        your
        forehead.
      </p>





      <p>
        Now grow even larger. Imagine yourself so vast that you can wrap your arms around the entire Earth in a loving
        embrace.
        Continue expanding until you're big enough to hold our entire galaxy, with all its planets and stars, within
        your cosmic embrace.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Considerations
      </h2>





      <p>
        Finally, a brief note about the technology you're using. While you can read these lessons on any
        device, computer,
        laptop, tablet, or phone, when you begin actively working with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, it's important to use good quality
        equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; is sensitive to low-performance devices and may respond
        erratically or stall occasionally when
        used on
        equipment that's struggling to keep up. This can also happen if your device is running updates in the
        background, which
        often occurs when you connect a charger to a mobile device.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you notice the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; isn't moving smoothly, you might want to wait
        for any background updates to
        complete, or
        adjust your device settings to temporarily pause them. The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; should
        flow with grace and ease, except
        during
        certain release phases which we'll discuss in our next module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that creating the right conditions for this work is an act of self-love and respect for the healing
        process. By
        preparing your body, mind, and environment, you're setting the stage for great results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take some time before our next session to consider how you might optimize your own healing space. What
        adjustments might
        you make to support your work with the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;? How can you ensure you're
        approaching this practice with
        clarity and presence?

      <h2>Module 10</h2>

      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <p>
        This is the final preparation before you begin working directly with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; tool to make you mission ready
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything we've explored so far has been laying the foundation for this moment. The instructions I'm about to
        share
        will also appear on the page where you'll use the actual &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;, so
        don't
        worry about memorizing everything
        right away. With practice, these steps will become second nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's walk through each step of the process together. If you're new to this work, remember to begin with the
        "Brain Stretch" exercise we explored in Module 9, this will help you expand your consciousness beyond your
        everyday
        awareness.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of the following guidance is meant to be followed silently, in the quiet space of your mind. There's no need
        to speak aloud, the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; responds to your conscious intention, not to
        your
        voice.
      </p>

      <p style="background-color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.323);">
        There's also something important I haven't mentioned before: the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;
        is
        meant for your eyes only during a
        session.
        Please don't invite someone else to watch while you're using it. The tool is likely to respond to both of your
        energetic
        fields simultaneously, creating patterns of movement that won't make sense to either of you. Think of it as a
        private
        conversation between you and your deeper consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be wondering how this tool can address mental health challenges like anxiety, depression, or specific
        phobias.
        These issues connect to you through magic numbers, much like the way a specific frequency can tune into a
        particular
        radio station. To work with any mental health concern, you'll focus on a feeling or urge associated with it and
        find the
        magic number that links to that experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this seems a bit abstract right now, please don't worry. Until this point, we've been exploring theory
        without
        practice. Soon you'll have hands-on experience with the tool, and everything will begin to make much more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that using this tool for the first time might feel intimidating. Many people find it helpful to print out
        the
        steps or take notes to reference during their first few sessions. I recommend reading through the instructions
        several
        times, then trying to recall them from memory.

        You'll likely make some mistakes at first, and that's perfectly okay. It's part of the learning process. Think
        about when
        you first learned to drive a car. At first, you had to consciously think about every action, turning the key,
        checking
        mirrors, applying the right pressure to the pedals. But with practice, these actions became automatic. The same
        will
        happen with the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.

        Remember that you're engaging in this healing work to improve yourself and your life, not as some form of
        punishment or
        obligation. Approach it with gentle curiosity rather than harsh judgment.

      <h2>The Healing Process</h2>

      <p>
        As a reminder, we use the term UTE for "Unifying Traumatic Experience", the merge incidents we've discussed in
        previous
        modules. The fundamental process for finding and releasing these merged experiences is beautifully simple:
      </p>
      There are just 2 steps shown below.
      <ol>
        <li>Find the 'UTE'</li>
        <li>Find the magic number</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, to ensure you're approaching this process with awareness and precision, we are going to expand these
        two
        steps into a seven-step protocol that includes important verification checks.
      </p>




      <hr>

      <p>
        There is no need to get flustered. We are still dealing with the above TWO steps, but now we just check it more
        thoroughly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the seven steps we'll follow:
      <ol>
        <li><b style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.323);">Find the 1st 'UTE'</b></li>
        <li>Make sure you found it</li>
        <li><b style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.323);">Find the magic number</b></li>
        <li>Did the 'merge' dissolve?</li>
        <li>If separation did not occur, go to 3</li>
        <li>Make SURE it dissolved</li>
        <li>Are all the merges dissolved for this problem?</li>
      </ol>
      </p>





      <hr>


      <h2>Step 1: Find the First UTE</h2>

      <p>
        Let's say you want to address a specific challenge, perhaps feelings of sadness, persistent depression, a
        phobia of
        spiders, or any other mental or emotional pattern that's disrupting your wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Begin by mentally addressing the universe while watching the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.
        In
        the silence of your mind, say, "Find the
        first UTE which links me to..." and then name your specific concern.
      </p>

      <p>
        This particular sequence of merged experiences becomes your "Target", the focus of your healing work.
      </p>




      <hr>

      <h2>Step 2: Make Sure You Found It</h2>

      <p>
        After stating your intention, ask, "Did you find it?" The &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;
        should
        respond with a brief movement to the right.
        If you don't see this confirmation, simply repeat the previous step until the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; indicates it has located the
        UTE.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you find that you're not getting any response at all, there are two possible explanations. Either the issue
        you're
        addressing isn't connected to a merge experience (which is rare), or, more likely, you're approaching it too
        broadly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, instead of focusing on "feeling depressed" as a general state, you might need to be more
        specific,
        such as
        "feeling depressed about my relationship" or "feeling depressed about my career path." The more precise you
        can
        be, the
        more effectively the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; can locate the corresponding UTE.
      </p>







      <hr>

      <h2>Step 3: Find the Magic Number</h2>

      <p>
        Using the halving method we learned in Module 7, find the magic number for the UTE you've just located. As you
        search,
        keep your Target from step 1 clearly in your awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        We typically begin our search at 5,000 and proceed from there, checking "greater than" or "less than" to
        narrow
        down the
        possibilities. When you've discovered the number, mentally tell your Target, "The number is..." and state the
        number
        you've found.
      </p>






      <hr>

      <h2>Step 4: Did the Merge Dissolve?</h2>

      <p>
        Always keep your attention on the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;. Within 1 to 5 seconds after
        telling your Target what the magic number is,
        you should observe a longer "release" movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        A release occurs when a merge dissolves, freeing you from the unconscious memories that weren't authentically
        yours.
        This release is often accompanied by a subtle sensation of tension leaving your body or mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along with an actual 'feeling' of relief, there are three distinct patterns that indicate a release, all
        lasting
        between 1 and several seconds:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A long, sustained movement to the right </li>
        <li>A quick movement to the right followed by a longer movement to the left </li>
        <li>An erratic, dance-like movement that goes in both left and right directions </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If you don't observe any of these release patterns, it likely means you haven't found the correct magic
        number.
        This
        happens sometimes, it's part of the process.







        <hr>

      <h2>Step 5: Make SURE It Dissolved</h2>

      <p>To verify that the merge has truly dissolved, ask your Target, "Did it dissolve?" or "Did it
        separate?", whichever
        terminology resonates more with you.</p>

      <p>
        If you don't receive a response, try asking the opposite: "Did it not dissolve?" or "Did it not separate?"
      </p>

      <p>
        These verification questions help ensure that you're accurately interpreting the responses from the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp;.
      </p>





      <hr>

      <h2>Step 6: If Separation Did Not Occur</h2>

      <p>
        If the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; indicates that separation did not occur, meaning the
        merged
        memories haven't been released, then your
        magic number isn't quite right. You might be off by a small amount, perhaps a few hundred or thousand, or you
        could be
        significantly off target.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, return to Step 3 and try working with very different numbers. You might start with 500, or
        perhaps 5
        million, or even 5 quadrillion, and proceed from there. Trust your intuition to guide you toward the right
        scale.
      </p>






      <hr>

      <h2>Step 7: Are All the Merges Dissolved for This Problem?</h2>

      <p>
        Once you've successfully released a merge, it's possible that you've reached the first UTE in the sequence.
        This
        is
        typically accompanied by a more profound sense of wellbeing or release than you've experienced with previous
        numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To check whether you've completed the entire sequence, you can ask your Target questions like:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>"Are we still connected?"</li>
        <li>"Gone?"</li>
        <li>"Went away?"</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If the Target is completely released, then asking "Are we still connected?" should receive no response, while
        questions
        like "Gone?" or "Went away?" should elicit a confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you haven't yet reached the first UTE in the sequence, simply return to Step 1 and repeat the process until
        you've
        fully resolved the issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to note that even though you always ask for the "first UTE," you will rarely find it on your
        first
        attempt. This is why you need to repeat the steps until you reach that initial merge point. The reason for
        this
        involves
        some complex aspects of consciousness that we won't explore just yet, but trust that the process works when
        followed with
        patience and presence.
      </p>






      <hr>

      <h2>A Journey of Healing</h2>

      <p>
        As we conclude this final preparation module, I want to remind you once more that a Unifying Traumatic
        Experience causes the time and location information surrounding that incident to become confused, creating a
        merge that connects
        you to many sources of psychological patterns that may not authentically belong to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process we've just explored allows you to identify these merges and release them, gradually restoring your
        true energetic signature and authentic emotional landscape.
      </p>

      <p>In our next module, you'll have the opportunity to begin working directly with the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; tool. Approach this
        practice with patience, curiosity, and compassion for yourself. Each step you take is bringing you closer to
        emotional freedom and authentic self-expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        I honor the courage and commitment you're bringing to this healing journey. Remember that transformation isn't
        always linear, there may be moments of profound insight followed by periods of integration. Trust the process
        and
        trust your inner wisdom as you move forward.

      <h2>Module 11</h2>
      <p>
        The general idea here is for you to practice the seven steps from your previous modules, but now you refine it further.

      </p>

      <p>
        The trick is to split your attention with 90% on a subject in your mind and only 10% on the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; Most newcomers will have ALL their attention on the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; because it is new and interesting, especially the first time you
        see it respond to a thought you had.
      </p>


      <p>
        You need to 'observe' the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; but 'work' on your inner world because
        that is where the things are that we want to fix. Spend a few hours doing this until you can do the seven steps
        without having to use the 'helper' we put below the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.&nbsp;
      </p>


      <p>
        The sensitivity setting ( The green button in the grey bar ) of the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; can be used to increase the 'detection' size of UTE's and other
        motions. Increasing it too much will make the device unusable because everything will be in motion. Experienced
        users will operate the device with sensitivity in the range of 10 - 25, but it's up to you. Do what works for
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
        To find UTE's just think about times when you were upset, depressed, angry, did something you regretted, said
        something you regretted etc. Any thought that generates a response on the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; is a UTE. You just need to 'find it', put your attention on it,
        find its Magic Number.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are more effective ways of finding UTE's which we explain in the next module but we want you to first get
        some practice here.
      </p>

      <p>
        We recommend at least 4 hours of aplication of this module before moving on to the next module

      <h2>Module 12</h2>
      <h3>Locate the Source</h3>

      <p>
        <i>Being: A being is any living creature, from a person to a bug. Being also refers to the state of existing.
          "To
          be, or not to be" , that is the question when you're talking about being. Things that exist are in a state of
          being: this meaning of being is a little vague, but it has to do with the way things are alive and real.
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Up until now you have been removing mental blocks ( UTE's 'merges' ) by either focusing on an unwanted emotion
        or
        by using a list of problems to find targets.
      </p>

      <p>You can make a list of things which disturb and upset you and then work through the list systimatically.
        When you think you have reached a point where your current list is no longer producing results. Wait a few weeks
        then
        come back to that list and it will produce new results.
        Meanwhile, make a new list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we want you to focus on other people directly. This is actually the prefered method of removing 'merges' and
        you should use the below method from now on. You may still use lists but use this new method. This can get quite
        active so be prepared.
      </p>



      <p>
        To clarify, the difference between this method and the previous is that here you locate a person or being in
        your
        mental space, THEN remove your 'merge' incidents from that person. The previous method had you locate a merge
        incident directly and then undo it, which can leave some stirred up energy unhandled. Always use this new method
        from now on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here you would, while watching the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>,&nbsp; focus your attention on a
        particular person or being. Trees, animals, pets etc are beings with which you may likely have UTE's with. It's
        not just about people, but most people would begin this section by seeking out other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get a read from the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; while putting your attention on a
        particular person then you <b>do</b> have UTE's with that person or being. You can also verify this by mentally
        asking the person or being "Do we have any UTE's?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have located a suitable person or being, you do as you did before, except that now the person or being
        is
        the target of your attention.
      </p>


      <p>
        If the concept of a "being" causes discomfort, it's worth remembering that you, too, are a being. The essence of
        life in any living entity stems from a being that interacts with and governs it. When life ends, the being
        itself
        does not perish; rather, it departs, potentially embarking on a new existence elsewhere. Embrace this
        perspective
        to alleviate any fears regarding other beings; they are fundamentally similar to you. This universal truth
        extends
        to everyone, including those you cherish and even those you may dislike. Each one is a being, just like you.
      </p>



      <p>
        So let's continue.<br>
      </p>



      <p>Now, before you panic and think, Oh nooooo..., more steps to learn. Don't worry, <b>it's still those same seven
          steps</b> as before, except that <i>before</i> step 1, you find a being in your mental space that provides a
        strong response on the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.&nbsp; Once you have a suitable being, you use
        the
        seven steps to remove your UTE's from that being.</p>

      <br><br>
      <hr><!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
      <br><br>




      <p>

      <ol>
        <li>Look in your mental space and find a being</li>
        <li>Tell the being to: Find the first UTE they have with you.</li>
        <li>Watch the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.&nbsp; You should get a response when they find it.</li>
        <li>If unsure, ask "Did you find it?" and look for the response.</li>
        <li>Now locate the magic number for that incident.</li>
        <li>Mentally tell the being what the magic number is.</li>
        <li>Make sure it is the correct number (did it separate etc).</li>
        <li>Repeat the above until you have <b>zero</b> UTE's with that being.</li>
        <li>Being is no longer detectable on the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.&nbsp; </li>
      </ol>
      </p>


      <p>
        Note that you could have as few as one UTE with the person or as many as several hundred. You don't have to undo
        them all in one sitting. Approach this process at a pace that's comfortable for you, addressing what you can in
        each sitting. Then, continue to work on them gradually, day by day, allowing yourself the time and space needed
        for thorough and thoughtful resolution.
      </p>


      <br><br>

      <br><br>

      <h2l>Additional Information</h2l>

      <p>
        Seeing as you have now had several hours of experience with the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>,&nbsp;
        you may also have noticed that the device sometimes twitches as if it's trying to get your attention or
        reprimand
        you for something. Well, all of that is true. You have been interacting with beings since the beginning and they
        will try and tell you things like "NO! the number is MUCH higher" or "HEY! get your attention back here and
        carry
        on" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding why a "being" can't simply identify and address the very first UTE can be perplexing. Here's a
        simplified explanation: Time and space are concepts that exist within a universe, not outside of it. Considering
        the multitude of universes that exist, most, if not all, could contain UTE's.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a being attempts to locate the first UTE, they typically find the earliest one within this universe. While
        this is a significant discovery, it's not the complete picture. If you refer to the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>,&nbsp; you'll notice there are additional UTE's with that being. These
        likely reside in other universes. But pinpointing the first universe a being existed in is complex because time
        doesn't function between universes in the way we understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a challenging concept to grasp and may require some reflection. Essentially, a being cannot directly access
        the first-ever UTE shared with you because there are multiple 'first' incidents across different universes, not
        just one. This complexity is a key aspect of understanding the nature of beings and their interactions across
        universes.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you look around in your mind you will find a great many "beings" with whom you have UTE's. Many of those
        incidents were quite traumatic at the time and can provide great relief when the incident is undone. It's the
        trapped emotions in those incidents that cause all the anxiety and other emotional problems which people have.
      </p>


    </div>

    <div id="Tab13" class="tabcontent">
      <h2>Module 13</h2>
      <h2>Advanced Methods</h2>

      <p>The distance method:</p>

      <p>
        In the previous module, we learned how to focus our attention on people and beings to identify and resolve our
        UTE's.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach is effective, but it assumes that you can readily identify a being in your mental space. However,
        what
        happens when you're dealing with an emotional issue or struggling to achieve a goal, yet you're unable to
        pinpoint
        the specific being associated with an UTE?
      </p>

      <p>
        To overcome this challenge, a more advanced technique known as "The Distance Method" is introduced. This method
        is
        particularly useful for discovering beings whose memories you have inadvertently absorbed, by focusing on
        spatial
        awareness.
      </p>


      <hr>

      <div style="display: flex; align-items: start;">
        <ol>
          <li>In front of me?</li>
          <li>To my right?</li>
          <li>To my left?</li>
          <li>Behind me?</li>
          <li>Above me?</li>
          <li>Below me?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      </p>




      <p>
        If you receive varying responses, focus on the direction that elicits the strongest reaction as your starting
        point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, determine the precise distance in that direction, such as 5.23 meters. Utilize the
        &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; to ascertain this distance, starting from a baseline of 5 meters
        and
        adjusting using 'greater than' or 'less than' as needed. At this stage, you should find this process
        straightforward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Distances typically range from 1 to 20 meters, though some may be as close as 0.1 millimeters or as far as
        several
        kilometers. It's crucial not to dwell on the significance of these distances; they are merely directional
        markers
        and numerical addresses for the beings in 'mind space', and do not correlate to physical distances. For example,
        a
        being located 2.12 meters above you is not literally in the ceiling, but at that distance in your mental
        perception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have determined the being's 'address', note it down. You can then apply the techniques from earlier to
        locate and address UTE's.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, you can identify a 'problem area' using a long list of potential problems, and then employ the
        distance method to find the being responsible. Once located, proceed as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll soon realize that you are connected to billions of beings in this manner. Addressing these connections is
        a
        considerable task, and it's recommended to dedicate around 2 hours daily to this practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        To help you find more UTE's you can also go onto Youtube and watch videos on topics you DO NOT like. Things that
        disturb you and make you feel uncomfortable usually stem from UTE's. Any thought that produces a right-movement
        on
        the RippleNav is a UTE and can be addressed using the above technique.
      </p>

      <p>Make a list of such things which disturb and upset you and then work through the list systematically.
        When you think you have reached a point where your current list is no longer producing results. Wait a few weeks
        then come back to that list and it will produce new results.
        Meanwhile, make a new list.
      </p>

      <p>You are connected to billions of beings in this manner and all of those UTE's are negatively impacting you in
        some way.
        If you think you can't find any UTE's then you are simply not trying hard enough or not looking in or avoiding
        potential areas.
        Get out of your comfort zone, that's where the problems are.
      </p>

      <p>
        The upcoming module, should not be attempted until you have invested over 400 hours in the current module.
        This extensive engagement is necessary for a critical reason: it involves identifying and resolving UTE's with a
        wide
        array of beings. This process is integral to significantly enhancing your awareness, preparing you to fully
        grasp
        and appreciate the advanced concepts and techniques that the next module offers offers.

      <h3>Beyond the Threshold of Eternity</h3>

      <p>
        In Gnosticism, the Demiurge is a lesser, ignorant, and often arrogant creator deity who mistakenly fashions the
        material world as a flawed, illusory prison for divine sparks. Unaware of the transcendent, true God (the Monad
        or
        Aether), the
        Demiurge believes himself to be the supreme being and actively traps fragments of divine consciousness (You)

        within his creation, which then suffer from amnesia regarding their true, higher timeless origin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our research indicates that these perceived flaws of the mind, the time location problem, are not accidental but
        intentional, collectively woven into our psyche by the Demiurge. This intricate design serves to heighten the
        challenge in the metaphysical game of life, a game that has been evolving through the vast stretches of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        By blurring and merging memories, he keeps the divine sparks confused, disoriented, and unable to fully remember
        their
        true nature, thereby preventing their escape. This would be a subtle, insidious form of imprisonment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Archonic Influence: The Archons (the Demiurge's subordinates) actively work to keep humanity ignorant and
        entangled.
        They might actively maintain or exacerbate these "memory merges" to preserve their control. They create war,
        famine,
        disease, and other forms of suffering to keep the divine sparks trapped in the material world, preventing them
        from
        awakening to their true nature and escaping the Demiurge's grasp. This is a form of spiritual warfare. </p>


      <p>
        Every time the devine sparks managed to collectively raise themselves above the threshold of the Demiurge's
        influence, it would unravel the game, however the devine sparks very unable to escape due to still having merged
        memories wihting the Demiurge creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The incorrect conclusion reached long ago by the devine sparks was that the game had unraveled because it had
        been to easy. It seemed clear: an 'easy' game lacks appeal. Simplicity led to bordom, hastening the end of game
        cycles prematurely.
        Therefore, we embraced complexity and challenge as core elements of this cosmic play, mistakingly believing it
        was for
        our benefit.
      </p>

      This cycle of creation and destruction
      has been repeated countless times, with each iteration becoming more complex and challenging than the last.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each iteration of this game, which we refer to as a 'cycle', is born from the lessons of it's predecessors. With
        each renewal, we were tricked into creating an even tougher version of the game, one that would keep us engaged
        and challenged.
      </p>



      <p>
        These cycles are termed 'eternities' not just as a poetic metaphor but to underscore their immense duration, a
        span so vast that earthly language falters in it's description. And indeed, there have been countless such
        eternities.
      </p>

          You can raise the roof of your awareness by doing the following exercise on the
          &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>.&nbsp;
        <ol>
          <li>Find the white flash of creation at the start of this eternity.</li>
          <li>You should get a read on the &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; when you 'see' the flash.</li>
          <li>Find how many beings were present at this creation event.</li>
          <li>For the above, it's a huge number, so rather find how many digits are in the number.</li>
          <li>You should find that the number contains 400 - 500 billion digits.</li>
          <li>When you get the exact number of digits, you will recognise the truth of it.</li>
          <li>Take a moment to realise that YOU were there.</li>
          <li>Take a moment to realise that YOU took part in this creation.</li>
          <li>Take a moment to realise that YOU thought, out of ignorance, it necessary to create a new eternity.</li>
          <li>This recognition of truth produces a large right-movement on the
            &nbsp;<image-text>RippleNav</image-text>&nbsp; and a feeling of elation which can last for several minutes
            (or days...)</li>
          <li>Take a break until you come off your high...</li>
          <li>Find out, as a percentage, how many of those beings you still have UTE's with.</li>
          <li>Repeat the above for the previous eternity.</li>
          <li>Do the above for the last 30 eternities ( or more ).</li>
          <li>Try and find out how many eternities you have been through.</li>
          <li>Try and find out how many current eternities exist which also have planet earth.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <p>
        It is interesting to note that the number found is different for each eternity.
