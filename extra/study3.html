          The Flow of Conscious and Unconscious
        </h2l>

        <p>
          This library of your mind can be understood as having two distinct wings or chambers, the conscious and the
          unconscious. Let's explore what these terms actually mean for your inner landscape.
        </p>

              Your conscious thoughts are those you're fully aware of and can intentionally direct. When you feel hunger arising in
              your body and decide to drive to a restaurant for nourishment, you're making a conscious choice. If someone were to ask
              what you're doing, you could easily explain your actions and the reasoning behind them. You're fully present with these
              thoughts and decisions, they exist within your awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unconscious thoughts, however, exist beneath the surface of your awareness, like the deeper currents beneath the ocean
              waves. Imagine suddenly feeling a wave of anger when you see something as simple and innocent as a tomato. This reaction
              makes no logical sense to your conscious mind. You aren't aware of any rational reason for this emotional response, it
              simply emerges from somewhere deeper within you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term "unconscious thoughts" isn't entirely accurate, because by definition, a thought is something we're aware
              of, and we aren't directly aware of what happens below our level of consciousness. This hidden realm is also sometimes
              called the subconscious mind, where "sub" beautifully indicates that these processes occur beneath our conscious
              awareness.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              So we can see that there are two primary forces guiding your actions and responses in any given moment:
              <br>
              (1) First, your conscious thoughts, which are decisions you make based on information you're aware of and can evaluate.
              <br>
              (2) Second, your unconscious influences, which manifest as reactions, inexplicable urges, seemingly irrational emotional
              responses, or decisions that later leave you wondering why you made them.

            </p>
            <p>Your conscious thoughts are mindfully chosen based on what your awareness recognizes as helpful or appropriate
            information.
            </p>
            <P>Your unconscious influences, however, emerge as reactions, unexplained impulses to act in ways that might not make
            logical sense, decisions that confuse you when you reflect on them later, or emotions that seem to arise from nowhere
            and feel beyond your control.</P>

                  Understanding this flow between the conscious and unconscious realms is our first step toward better understanding. In
                  our next module, we'll begin exploring how these two aspects of your mind interact and how you can bring greater harmony
                  to their relationship.

                  Are you beginning to recognize how these unconscious influences might be shaping your performance Agent? Take a moment to
                  reflect on a recent emotional reaction that surprised you. This awareness is already the beginning of your
                  change to super agent.
