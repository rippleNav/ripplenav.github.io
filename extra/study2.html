      <p>As we move to the next step of your training, Agent, let's tackle these hidden forces that shape your reality.
        To win
        this battle, we need to understand a simple but important idea about how your mind works.</p>
      <p>Nobody fully understands the mind, not even our top experts. Different specialists have their own ideas about
        it.
        Western doctors often say the mind is in the physical brain, while spiritual experts see it as energy or
        consciousness
        that goes beyond your body.</p>
      <p>For our mission, you don't need to pick one theory about where the mind lives. Instead, we'll use a simple
        model that
        helps us create powerful tools. These secret tools will help fight anxiety, depression, negativity, and other
        enemies
        that stop you from reaching your full potential and creating your best life.</p>
      <p>In our model, the mind works like your personal secret files, storing memories and experiences. Knowledge is
        key for
        navigating your life in this world. The fact that you can understand these words is because you can access
        memories of
        how you learned to read and understand language.</p>
